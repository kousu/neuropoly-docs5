# MSc \| PhD \| PostDoc Positions

At the NeuroPoly lab at Polytechnique & Universit√© de Montr√©al \(www.neuro.polymtl.ca\), best student-city in the world! \([https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2017](https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2017)\), we develop advanced MRI image analysis techniques using deep learning and distribute them as open-source software. In collaboration with neuroradiologists and world experts in deep learning \(Mila\), we apply these tools in patients with traumatic injury and neurodegenative diseases \(multiple sclerosis, ALS, etc.\).

We are recruiting Master/PhD students and Postdoc fellows to work on various projects:Edit

### Deep Learning for Medical Applications \(in partnership with Mila\) ‚öôÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è <a id="deep_learning_for_medical_applications_in_partnership_with_mila_&#x2699;&#xFE0F;&#x2699;&#xFE0F;"></a>

* **Multiple sclerosis \(MS\) lesion segmentation on MRI**
  * Description: Segment MS lesions in order to help classify these patients \(phenotype, personalized therapy\). Dataset: MRIs of ~650 patients from 12 international clinical centers, MS lesions labeled by neuroradiologists. Methods: Develop/apply advanced deep learning architectures \(FiLM, HEMIS, etc.\).
