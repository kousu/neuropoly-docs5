# Ex Vivo Imaging of Spinal Cord Injury

## Validation Using Histology

![](../../.gitbook/assets/exvivo_histology.png)

Model of spinal cord injury. The left panel shows the MRI performed in vivo after the injury. The middle and right panel respectively show the injury during dissection and after histology. The top histology slice shows that the injury spans the dorsal left segment, affecting both the dorsal column \(sensory\) and the corticospinal tract \(ascending\). The bottom histology slice shows uninjured tissue. V=Ventral, D=Dorsal, L=Left, R=Right
